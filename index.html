Placement preparation

Here is a small piece of advice for all those who are sitting for placement. As I am a CS guy, most of the advice given here, will be helpful 
for them only. I would start with technical guidance. You need to have good algorithmic coding skills to clear the coding test. You can start
practicing coding at "https://leetcode.com/". Other compulsory algorithmic coding stuff is compiled in "Cracking the coding interview". 
Apart from this, one can go through codes given in "http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" in "Algo" section. This was about coding tests. Written test
consists of basics of OS, ToC, Networks, DBMS and OOPs. Apart from going through slides of the courses, you should go through previous papers of 
GATE, as most of the questions are from there only.

For interviews, you need to preprare your resume in such a way, so that you know every bit of that. Donot write anything which you donot know in 
your resume. Go through all the projects which you have mentioned in your resume. You should practice demo interviews. The interviewer will be 
checking your approach most of the time, so try to be clear on your thoughts. Try to compare the problem with the previous problems you have 
solved and reduce the given problem to a smaller one until you reach the one you know the solution of. Try writing the code in a piece of paper, 
as you donot have backspace in the interview room. A clean code with least redundancy written in first go is all the interviewer wants, so donot 
start writing the code until you are convinced with your algorithm.

That's it. All the best !!!!!!
